# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
Hi, I'm Masturah and this is one of my little corner of Cyber-Techieness

This is my âœ¨Brainwave_Matrix_Internâœ¨ repository. The cozy spot where I'm keeping all the exciting and brain-sparking tasks I'll be working on during my internship with Brainwave Matrix.

I'm super hyped about the cybersecurity projects, building cool scripts, and learning as I go. You're welcome to explore... but dont snoop *too* hard, heheðŸ’œ

## Task 1: Phishing Link ScannerðŸ’œ
**Script:** 'cyberpaw_scanner.py'

This Python script scans suspicious URLs and helps detect phishing attempts. Cute name, serious job.

Tech Tools
-Python
-Regex
-Requests library (for link checking)
-Terminal Magic

## Task 2: CyberPaw Password Strength Checker ðŸ’œ

**Folder**: CyberPaw_Strength_Checker/
**Script**: 'cyberpaw_password_checker.py'

A Python script that checks how strong (or weak) your password is. Itâ€™s simple, direct, and a reminder to ditch password123 for something a little more... cyberpaw-approved.

Tech Tools:
- Python  
- Regex (`re`)  
- Colorama (`Fore`, `Style`)  
- hashlib (`sha256`)



Made with a lot of learning & a lil' bit of magic
